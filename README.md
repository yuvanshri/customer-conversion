🛍️ Customer Conversion Analysis Using Clickstream Data
📘 Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent and interactive Streamlit web application that leverages clickstream data to enhance customer engagement and drive sales for a leading e-commerce platform such as Amazon, Walmart, or eBay.

The application tackles three core machine learning tasks:

Classification: Predict if a user will complete a purchase.

Regression: Estimate the revenue a customer is likely to generate.

Clustering: Segment customers based on browsing behavior.

By implementing these models, the system delivers data-driven insights to improve conversions, boost revenue, and personalize the customer experience.

🎯 Business Use Cases
🔍 Customer Conversion Prediction – Enhance marketing effectiveness by targeting likely buyers.

💸 Revenue Forecasting – Improve strategic planning by estimating future spending.

👥 Customer Segmentation – Enable personalized recommendations and marketing.

🔁 Churn Reduction – Detect likely cart abandoners and re-engage them.

🛒 Product Recommendation – Suggest relevant products based on behavioral patterns.

🧠 ML Approach
1. 🧼 Data Preprocessing
Datasets:

train.csv: Model training

test.csv: Model testing/validation

Missing Values:

Numerical: Replaced with mean/median

Categorical: Replaced with mode

Encoding:

One-Hot / Label Encoding for categorical data

Scaling:

StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler for numerical features

2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations:

Bar charts, histograms, pair plots

Session Analysis:

Duration, bounce rate, page views

Correlation Heatmaps:

Identify feature relationships

Temporal Patterns:

Day, hour, and time-on-site analysis

3. 🛠️ Feature Engineering
Session Metrics: Session length, number of clicks, time per product category

Clickstream Patterns: Browsing paths, product transitions

Behavioral Metrics: Bounce rate, exit rate, revisits

4. ⚖️ Balancing Techniques (For Classification)
Class Imbalance Handling:

Oversampling: SMOTE

Undersampling: Random removal

Class Weight Adjustments: Penalize misclassifications of the minority class

5. 🤖 Model Building
✅ Supervised Models
Classification:
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks

Regression:
Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Gradient Boosting Regressors

🔍 Unsupervised Models
Clustering:
K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering

⚙️ Pipeline Automation
Scikit-learn Pipelines:

Preprocessing → Scaling → Modeling → Hyperparameter Tuning → Evaluation

6. 📏 Model Evaluation
Task	Metrics
Classification	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
Regression	MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²
Clustering	Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, WCSS

7. 🖥️ Streamlit Application
💡 Key Features:
Upload CSV files or manually enter customer data

Real-time predictions for:

Purchase Conversion (Classification)

Revenue Estimation (Regression)

Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

Interactive visualizations:

Bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and cluster visualizations
