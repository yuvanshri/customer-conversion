Problem Statement:
Imagine you are a data scientist working at a leading e-commerce giant like Amazon, Walmart, or eBay. Your goal is to develop an intelligent and user-friendly Streamlit web application that leverages clickstream data to enhance customer engagement and drive sales.
The application should:
Classification Problem: Predict whether a customer will complete a purchase (1) or not (2) based on their browsing behavior.
Regression Problem: Estimate the potential revenue a customer is likely to generate, helping the business forecast revenue and optimize marketing strategies.
Clustering Problem: Segment customers into distinct groups based on their online behavior patterns, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and personalized product recommendations.
By building this application, you aim to empower the business with data-driven insights to increase conversions, boost revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Business Use Cases:
Customer Conversion Prediction: Enhance marketing efficiency by targeting potential buyers.
Revenue Forecasting: Optimize pricing strategies by predicting user spending behavior.
Customer Segmentation: Group users into clusters for better personalization.
Churn Reduction: Detect users likely to abandon carts and enable proactive re-engagement.
Improved Product Recommendations: Suggest relevant products based on browsing patterns.

Approach:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   Dataset Details:
   Train.csv: Used to train machine learning models.
   Test.csv: Used to validate model performance and simulate real-world scenarios.
   Handling Missing Values:
   Replace missing values using mean/median for numerical data and mode for categorical data.
   Feature Encoding:
   Convert categorical features into numerical using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
   Scaling and Normalization:
   Apply MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler for numerical features to improve model performance.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Visualizations:
   Use bar charts, histograms, and pair plots to understand distributions and relationships.
   Session Analysis:
   Analyze session duration, page views, and bounce rates.
   Correlation Analysis:
   Identify relationships between features using correlation heatmaps.
   Time-based Analysis:
   Extract features like hour of the day, day of the week, and browsing duration.

3. Feature Engineering:
   Session Metrics:
   Calculate session length, number of clicks, and time spent per product category.
   Clickstream Patterns:
   Track click sequences to identify browsing paths.
   Behavioral Metrics:
   Bounce rates, exit rates, and revisit patterns.

4. Balancing Techniques (For Classification Models):
   Identify Imbalance:
   Analyze the distribution of target labels (converted vs. not converted).
   Techniques for Balancing:
   Oversampling: Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to create synthetic samples.
   Undersampling: Randomly remove majority class samples to balance the dataset.
   Class Weight Adjustment: Assign higher weights to the minority class during model training.

5. Model Building:
   Supervised Learning Models:
   Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
   Regression: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Gradient Boosting Regressors.
   Unsupervised Learning Models:
   Clustering: K-means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.
   Pipeline Development:
   Use Scikit-learn Pipelines to automate:
   Data preprocessing → Feature scaling → Model training → Hyperparameter tuning → Evaluation.

6. Model Evaluation:
   Classification Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC Curve.
   Regression Metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
   Clustering Metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Within-Cluster Sum of Squares.

7. Streamlit Application Development:
   Interactive Web Application:
   Build a Streamlit interface that allows users to upload CSV files or input values manually.
   Key Features:
   Real-time predictions for conversion (classification).
   Revenue estimation (regression).
   Display customer segments (clustering visualization).
   Show visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and histograms. this my project description get github readme
